 We can use this space to think about how we want to organize this repository.  For now, we could maybe just brainstorm lots of different categories we might want.

Brainstorm:

Vision documents
Addressing basic needs:  water, food, housing, fuel, clothing, sanitation, medicine, transportation
Community business ideas:  nut oil pressing, biochar production, useful plants nursery
Communication resources:  links to articles on NVC, consensus decision making, etc
