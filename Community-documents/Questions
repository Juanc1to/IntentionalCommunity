Random questions and answers go here.  Please include your name both when you ask and answer a question.  Example:  "Q (Steve): What is 1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1?  A (Lorna):  If I counted correctly, the answer is 9.".  It is okay to ask and answer a question yourself to share your thoughts on an issue.

Q (Steve):  What size of community are we aiming for?  10 people?  100?  1000?
  A (Steve):  I am thinking about aiming for a community which is initially small (5-10 people), but leaving open the possibility that we might expand both in people and acreage as finances and interest allow.

Q (Steve):  Are we looking to have any community businesses?  How will the community function financially?  
	A: (Steve):  I personally would like to have some community businesses which can stack multiple functions, and provide real services to the larger community.  For instance, a nut oil pressing business would be useful in almost any conceivable future.  Whether we are operating in our current capitalist economic reality, or an ideal gift-economy future, having the ability to transform nuts which are useless to humans (tannin rich butternuts and acorns) into cooking oil is awesome.  Millions of calories are just rotting away in the woods.  The press meal is also useful as fertilizer, or as feedstock for biochar production.  Biochar is another awesome business idea:  sequestering carbon permanently in soil, while improving the soil, and generating heat and power.  In general, it would be useful to brainstorm other ideas like this which would benefit the larger community (not just ourselves), have positive environmental externalities, and serve multiple functions.
